# Duplicate Systems Merge Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the work done to identify and merge duplicate systems in the CubicChunks121 mod. The analysis revealed several duplicate implementations that were consolidated into unified, high-performance systems.

## Identified Duplicate Systems

### 1. Chunk Management Systems

**Duplicates Found:**
- `src/main/java/com/radexin/cubicchunks/chunk/CubicChunkManager.java` (360 lines)
- `src/main/java/com/radexin/cubicchunks/world/CubicChunkManager.java` (390 lines)

**Issues:**
- Both provided chunk loading/unloading functionality
- Different approaches to player tracking and priority management
- Inconsistent interfaces and feature sets
- Memory overhead from maintaining two systems

**Solution:**
Created `UnifiedCubicChunkManager.java` that combines:
- Advanced spatial partitioning from both implementations
- High-performance async loading with CompletableFuture
- Intelligent player-based priority system
- Optimized memory management with LRU eviction
- Batch loading for better performance
- Comprehensive performance tracking

### 2. Storage Systems

- `src/main/java/com/radexin/cubicchunks/lighting/Enhanced3DLightEngine.java` (769 lines)

**Issues:**
- Three different lighting algorithms with varying complexity
- Inconsistent 3D light propagation approaches
- Different performance characteristics
- No unified lighting interface

**Solution:**
Created `UnifiedCubicLightEngine.java` that combines:
